That means it could try every possible Windows passcode in a typical enterprise in less than six hours. There is no record of anyone building a faster machine since.</li><li>5) About 40% of organizations store privileged and administrative passwords in a Word document or spreadsheet.</li><li>6) It would take a typical brute-force password cracking program 12 years, four months and 16 days to unscramble the random eight-character password “z7S69s@9.”</li><li>7) The same password would have taken a cracker built with 1990 technology 6,495 years.</li><li>8) In 2020 it’ll take about 9 years, six months and 18 days.</li><li>9) Experts believe a quantum computer will be able to do it in less than five seconds.</li><li>10) When people are asked to include a number in a password, the majority simply add a “1” or a “2” at the end.</li><li>11) Two-thirds of people use no more than two passwords for all their online accounts.</li><li>12) The top 10 most-used password list has barely changed in the last five years.</li><li>13) Experts says a great technique for creating a secure password is to use the first letter of each word in a phrase (esagtfcaspitutfloewiap). Mixing in a single random symbol (!*$@) dramatically improves security.</li><li>14) Thirty percent of phishing emails get opened.</li><li>15) Nine out of 10 phishing emails carried ransomware in March, 2016.</li><li>16) Many experts now believe that frequent password changes actually worsen computer security because people tend to choose minor variations of their current passwords so they’ll be 17 easier to remember.</li><li>17) This is a list of the 10,000 most frequently used passwords. If any of yours are on it, your account will be compromised in seconds by any of the most common dictionary-based cracking tools.</li><li>18) Retail was the most-targeted industry for phishing attacks in the first quarter of 2016 by more than a two-to-one margin over any other industry.</li><li>19) An eight-character password using only upper- or lower-case characters has 200 billion potential combinations.</li><li>20) An eight-character password using a combination of upper- and lower-case characters has 53 trillion billion potential combinations.</li><br/><br/><a href="/">Back</a></p></body></html>
